# Blog-app
A simple blog that can add, edit, delete and view blog's post and category. There only authenticated users that can access this blog. 
After user login, user can do CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operation on post and category.

## Tools
It is a MEAN Stack project. For server-side used NodeJS 14 and for the client-side used Angular 11.
1. Node.js
2. MongoDB
3. Angular 
4. Angular CLI
5. Express.js
6. Passport.js
7. Mongoose.js
8. CKEditor 5
9. Terminal or Command Line
10. IDE or Text Editor (VS Code)

##  How to run
Run them separately to make development easier and lightweight. For that, Open 3 terminal tabs to run MongoDB daemon, Express.js and Angular.
First terminal tap:
```bash
mongod
```
Second terminal tap inside the Blog-app/server folder:
```bash
nodemon
```
Third terminal tap inside the blog-app/client folder:
```bash
ng serve
```

##Roadmap
I'm planing to continue developing the project.
on the plan: 
1. Make it a Doker friend!
